Usage:
  go2v [option] test
    Go2V tests itself with its testing suite located in `tests`.

Options:
  -compact       - Run tests without the `-stats` option.
  -create <name> - Create a new tests/<name> directory, with an empty <name>.go file
  -out <name>    - Run go2v to generate a tests/<name>/<name>.vv file

Creating a new test for go2v requires 2 steps.

Step 1. go2v test -create new_test_name

This will create a new subdirectory under tests, using the given name, and also
create an "empty" .go file in the same subdirectory, also using the given name.

Once you have edited the new_test_name.go file, run

Step 2. go2v test -out new_test_name

to generate the tests/new_test_name/new_test_name.vv file which will be compared
against the output of go2v in the future, to ensure the output hasn't changed.

Note that this will ONLY create new tests in the go2v/tests subdir.
